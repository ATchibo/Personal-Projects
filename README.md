# Personal-Projects

This is a repository containing my most important projects, from the 9th grade up until now, presented in chronological order (mostly). Not all of them are very polished, but I promise that all of them have soul and a great personality :D.

This is a very brief description of all of them:

## QR&Barcode Scanner
This was my first project ever created in Android Studio and it is exactly what it says in the title: a simple scanner which also has an option to save the scanned content in a list for later use.
## Tic Tac Toe
This is an Android game in which you can play against the phone (with 4 difficulty levels) or against one of your friends.
## Space Battle
Another Android game in which you control a spaceship which tries to fight against an opponent ship. Your objective is to destroy the enemy ship for as many rounds as you can.
## Minesweeper 
Surprisingly (or not), a mobile implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.
## Watch Out
This time, the game was made in Unity. The objective is to identify every round the required object in a specified time frame. After 3 mistakes, the game ends.

## Transport Public Suceava

(fun fact: I made this app more as an experiment and some people got mad at the local council because they thought this was the official app and it didn't look like an app made by some professionals)
