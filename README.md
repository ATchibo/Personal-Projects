# Personal-Projects

This is a repository containing my most important projects, from the 9th grade up until now, presented in chronological order (mostly). Not all of them are very polished, but I promise that all of them have soul and a great personality :D.

This is a very brief description of all of them:

## QR&Barcode Scanner
This was my first project ever created in Android Studio and it is exactly what it says in the title: a simple scanner which also has an option to save the scanned content in a list for later use.

## Tic Tac Toe
This is an Android game in which you can play against the phone (with 4 difficulty levels) or against one of your friends.

## Space Battle
Another Android game in which you control a spaceship which tries to fight against an opponent ship. Your objective is to destroy the enemy ship for as many rounds as you can.

## Minesweeper 
Surprisingly (or not), a mobile implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

## Watch Out
This time, the game was made in Unity. The objective is to identify every round the required object in a specified time frame. After 3 mistakes, the game ends.

## Casual Escape Room
This is an EscapeRoom type of game. You have the chance of trying to escape from 2 different buildings using different objects.
Features:
- one of the few games on Google Play of this type which has 3D objects and free movement
- friendly controls
- you can adjust different graphics levels to adjust your hardware and camera sensibility
Please note that this is a demo version of the game made by 4 teenagers, so don't expect
this to be a professional game.

## ColorX
ColorX is a game in which your main task is to color as many tiles as possible with the help of your desired character.
You can choose between 5 characters and 5 maps, each one of them with different perks and quirks.
You have the ability to compete against 3 bots, on 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard.
Your objective is to have the most tiles in your color by the end of each match in order to receive your prize.
Also, the game features a daily and video reward system, which can help you out when you run out of money or just want to buy that thing faster.
We hope you'll enjoy our game and feel free to tell us if something goes wrong. We're just some students who want to learn and have fun in their free time (which by the way isn't a lot), so you shouldn't compare this game to some bigger games, because you will be disappointed.

## Transport Public Suceava
Have you ever been in the situation of needing a bus in Suceava and you don't know what to choose? Poor chances, but this application could help you!
This application contains the routes and schedules of all public passenger transport lines that are available in Suceava. You can also get a list of buses running between two stations of your choice.

## Info Bac (or by the initial, cooler name: Bac1nf0)
Bac1nf0 is an application intended for all those who want to deepen and recapitulate the computer science subjects studied in high school according to the curriculum established by the Ministry of Education, also valid for the Baccalaureate exam.

## Chicken Defender
A Desktop game, available on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721090/Chicken_Defender/

## My first complete web app
Even though I played with React and Spring boot in the past, this was my first fully-working web application developed from scratch and deployed in the cloud. 
The frontend is built using React, while the backend is written in Java using Spring Boot. For the database, I chose PostgereSQL.
The backend and database were deployed on an AWS EC2 instance and the frontend app was deployed on Vercel.
